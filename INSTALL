============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Bluefish requires a few external dependencies to run. They are:

- CUDA 5.0 or 5.5
- OpenMPI
- CUSP C++ Templated Sparse Matrix Library (http://cusplibrary.github.com)
- CGNS & HDF5

=========
CONFIGURE
=========

To tell Bluefish where to find the required dependencies, edit the Makefile.
Enter the full path to the installation location of each dependency (the
path to directory containing /include and /lib directories) in the section
entitled EDIT: DEPENDENCIES. Also, enter the path to your compiler binary in the
section entitled EDIT: COMPILERS.

=======
COMPILE
=======

From this directory, compile Bluefish using make. You have a few choices:

$ make          -- Compile to run with verbose standard output.
$ make batch    -- Compile to run with slightly less chatty output (for
                   batch jobs).
$ make clean    -- Delete the compiled object files and linked binary.

When compiled, the binary will reside in the directory bluefish/sim.

==================
RUNNING BLUEBOTTLE
==================

Launch Bluefish from the command line by navigating to the bluefish/sim
directory and typing

$ ./bluefish

This will read the required input files in bluefish/sim/input and write
the requested output files to bluefish/sim/output. Some useful runtime
information will be written to bluefish/sim/record. There are a number of
canonical input files distributed in the bluefish/sim/input directory. To use
one, simply rename it to flow.config.

For a detailed discussion about the required input files, see the Bluefish
Wiki at http://lucan.me.jhu.edu/wiki/index.php/Configuration_files.
